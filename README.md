Communitytags
=============
Communitytags allows the community to add tags to ArchLinux packages.  The tags are stored in http://github.com/ids1024/archcommunitytags.

The extra directory contains some scripts that are useful for maintaining the tag database.  At some point, they probably be combined into a single tool and installed by setup.py.
