Communitytags
=============
Communitytags allows the community to add tags to ArchLinux packages.  The tags are stored in http://github.com/ids1024/archcommunitytags.

The extra directory contains some scripts that are useful for maintaining the tag database.  At some point, they probably be combined into a single tool and installed by setup.py.

Contributing Tags
-----------------
The intent of this program is to allow the community to tag packages, so contributions are welcome.  The current method is to [request collaborator access](https://github.com/ids1024/archcommunitytags/issues/1) to the tags repository and push any changes.  If you would prefer, you can instead [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ids1024/archcommunitytags/pulls).
